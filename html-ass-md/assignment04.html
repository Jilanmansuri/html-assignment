  <h2 id="early">Early Computers</h2>
  <p>
    The story of computers begins with mechanical devices like the <strong>abacus</strong> and <em>Charles Babbage’s</em> Analytical Engine. These machines laid the foundation for modern computing. 
    In the 1940s, the <abbr title="Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer">ENIAC</abbr> was developed — one of the first electronic general-purpose computers. 
    It used <mark>vacuum tubes</mark> and consumed massive amounts of power. <b>Alan Turing</b>, often called the father of computer science, introduced the concept of a <i>universal machine</i> capable of solving any computable problem.
    The <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> became the brain of the computer, executing instructions and managing operations.
    Early computers were <u>bulky</u>, <strong>expensive</strong>, and <small>limited in functionality</small>.

    “The computer was born to solve problems that did not exist before.” — <cite>Bill Gates</cite>

  <h2 id="generations">Generations of Computers</h2>
  <p>
    Computers evolved through <b>five generations</b>. The first used vacuum tubes, while the second introduced <ins>transistors</ins>, making machines smaller and faster. 
    The third generation saw the rise of <strong>integrated circuits</strong>, and the fourth brought <em>microprocessors</em> — revolutionizing personal computing.
    The fifth generation focuses on <mark>artificial intelligence</mark> and <abbr title="Natural Language Processing">NLP</abbr>. 
    Each generation improved speed, reliability, and accessibility. 
    For example, the formula <var>E</var> = <var>mc</var><sup>2</sup> was once calculated manually, but now even a <kbd>smartphone</kbd> can process it instantly.
    <del>Punch cards</del> were replaced by <ins>graphical user interfaces</ins> and touchscreens.

  <h2 id="internet">Birth of the Internet</h2>
  <p>
    The internet began as a military project called <abbr title="Advanced Research Projects Agency Network">ARPANET</abbr> in the late 1960s. 
    It allowed multiple computers to communicate over long distances. 
    The invention of <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and the <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> in the 1990s transformed the internet into a global phenomenon.
    <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong> played a key role in this transformation. 
    The internet enabled email, websites, and online collaboration. 
    <code>GET /index.html HTTP/1.1</code> is a basic example of how browsers request web pages.
    <mark>Connectivity</mark> became the backbone of modern life.

  <h2 id="modern">Modern Era</h2>
  <p>
    Today’s computers are <strong>powerful</strong>, <em>portable</em>, and <u>ubiquitous</u>. 
    Devices like tablets, smartphones, and smartwatches are part of everyday life. 
    Cloud computing allows users to store data remotely and access it from anywhere. 
    Technologies like <code>JavaScript</code>, <code>Python</code>, and <code>Node.js</code> power dynamic web applications.
    The formula for calculating interest — <var>A</var> = <var>P</var>(1 + <var>r</var>)<sup>n</sup> — can now be coded and executed in seconds.
    <samp>Access granted</samp> or <samp>Error 404</samp> are common system messages.
    <kbd>Ctrl + C</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl + V</kbd> are universal shortcuts.
    The internet continues to evolve with <mark>5G</mark>, <mark>IoT</mark>, and <mark>AI</mark>.
